x86info v1.4            http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/x86info
Dave Jones <davej@suse.de>

This program started life as a cpuid program by Phil Karn.
It's been modified considerably, and much more is planned.

Features:
 - SMP support.
 - Recognition of all Intel/AMD/IDT/Cyrix CPUs.
 - Parsing of model specific registers.
 - Approximation of current CPU MHz.

Caveats:
   For usage of the MSR / SMP functions, x86info
   needs the x86 cpuid driver provided with kernel
   2.2.18 / 2.4.0, and the appropriate nodes in /dev


Command line switches:

?, --help
 Show command line arguments.

-a, --all
 Show all information. This turns on -c, -f, -m, -r

-c, --cacheinfo
 Show TLB / Cache sizes/associativity.

-f, --flags
 Show features supported by CPU(s)

-m, --msr
 Dump model specific registers.
 Currently only undocumented Athlon registers for research purposes.
 Future versions will include parsing of bits in MSRs for all
 processors.

-mhz, --mhz
 Estimate current MHz.

-r, --registers
 Dump register values from all cpuid calls possible.
