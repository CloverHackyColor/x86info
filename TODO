higher priority stuff
---------------------
- feature flag handling code could use more cleanup.
- Make intel cache sizing use cpuid(4) where present.
- After identifying CPU we can associate more info with the CPU.
  - CPU codename
  - Introduction date
  - number of transistors
  - voltages (I/O, Core, Maximum)
  - number of pipelines
- Be able to tell the user when we have failed to identify the chip, so they can send us information!
- Add some additional tools, rename package to 'x86utils' ?
  - Report north bridge info (requires pci lib)


medium priority stuff
---------------------

- introduce hexdump option (-x) to dump register values in addition to decoding.
- Some CPUs allow the name string to be changed.
  If this has happened we die horribly. We need to store the current
  name string, perform the cpuid reset sequence, and restore the
  name string on exit.
- Fix benchmarking


low priority stuff
------------------
- Identify Transmeta CPUs.
- Dump cyrix ARR registers when we pass --mtrr
- review code for extended natsemi support.
