- Recognise CPUs with bugs, and print warnings
  if workarounds are not enabled. For example..
  "Stepping D0 Duron detected with Cache size bug.
   You should upgrade your kernel to work around this bug"

- Intel cache sizing code could be improved.
  See arch/i386/kernel/setup.c from kernel

- Recognise different types of Celerons
  (cache size)

- Flags code needs an update. It was taken from the
  kernel before hpa cleaned it up.

- --gcc option to output best optimisation parameters
  for that CPU.

- --check-mca
  Useful for polling from a script to check for errors
  that don't raise MCE

- Some CPUs allow the name string to be changed.
  If this has happened we die horribly. We need to store the current
  name string, perform the cpuid reset sequence, and restore the
  name string on exit.
